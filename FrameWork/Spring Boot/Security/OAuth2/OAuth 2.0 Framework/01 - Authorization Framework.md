### Abstract

The OAuth 2.0 authorization framework enables a third-party application to obtain limited access to an HTTP service, either on behalf of a resource owner by orchestrating an approval interaction between the resource owner and the HTTP service, or by allowing the third-party application to obtain access on its own behalf.  This specification replaces and obsoletes the OAuth 1.0 protocol described in [RFC 5849](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5849).
