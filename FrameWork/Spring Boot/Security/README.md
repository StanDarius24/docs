Spring Security is a framework that provides [authentication](https://docs.spring.io/spring-security/reference/features/authentication/index.html), [authorization](https://docs.spring.io/spring-security/reference/features/authorization/index.html), and [protection against common attacks](https://docs.spring.io/spring-security/reference/features/exploits/index.html). With first class support for securing both [imperative](https://docs.spring.io/spring-security/reference/servlet/index.html) and [reactive](https://docs.spring.io/spring-security/reference/reactive/index.html) applications, it is the de-facto standard for securing Spring-based applications.

If you are ready to start securing an application see the Getting Started sections for [servlet](https://docs.spring.io/spring-security/reference/servlet/getting-started.html) and [reactive](https://docs.spring.io/spring-security/reference/reactive/getting-started.html). These sections will walk you through creating your first Spring Security applications.

If you want to understand how Spring Security works, you can refer to the [Architecture](https://docs.spring.io/spring-security/reference/servlet/architecture.html) section.
