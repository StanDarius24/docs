## **2. What Is Inversion of Control?**

Inversion of Control is a principle in software engineering which transfers the control of objects or portions of a program to a container or framework. We most often use it in the context of object-oriented programming.

In contrast with traditional programming, in which our custom code makes calls to a library, IoC enables a framework to take control of the flow of a program and make calls to our custom code. To enable this, frameworks use abstractions with additional behavior built in.Â **If we want to add our own behavior, we need to extend the classes of the framework or plugin our own classes.**

The advantages of this architecture are:

-   decoupling the execution of a task from its implementation
-   making it easier to switch between different implementations
-   greater modularity of a program
-   greater ease in testing a program by isolating a component or mocking its dependencies, and allowing components to communicate through contracts

We can achieve Inversion of Control through various mechanisms such as: Strategy design pattern, Service Locator pattern, Factory pattern, and Dependency Injection (DI).

We're going to look at DI next.
