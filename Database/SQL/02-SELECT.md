The `SELECT` statement is used to select data from a database.The data returned is stored in a result table, called the result-set.

### SELECT Syntax

```sql
SELECT _column1_, _column2, ..._  
FROM _table_name_;
```

Here, column1, column2, ... are the field names of the table you want to select data from. If you want to select all the fields available in the table, use the following syntax:

```sql
SELECT * FROM _table_name_;
```
