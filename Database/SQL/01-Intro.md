SQL is a standard language for accessing and manipulating databases.

What Can SQL do:
-   SQL can execute queries against a database
-   SQL can retrieve data from a database
-   SQL can insert records in a database
-   SQL can update records in a database
-   SQL can delete records from a database
-   SQL can create new databases
-   SQL can create new tables in a database
-   SQL can create stored procedures in a database
-   SQL can create views in a database
-   SQL can set permissions on tables, procedures, and views

However, to be compliant with the ANSI standard, they all support at least the major commands (such as `SELECT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, `INSERT`, `WHERE`) in a similar manner.

## RDBMS
- stands for Relational Database Management System.

RDBMS is the basis for SQL, and for all modern database systems such as MS SQL Server, IBM DB2, Oracle, MySQL, and Microsoft Access.

The data in RDBMS is stored in database objects called tables. A table is a collection of related data entries and it consists of columns and rows.

## Keep in Mind That...

-   SQL keywords are NOT case sensitive: `select` is the same as `SELECT`

-   `UPDATE` - updates data in a database
-   `DELETE` - deletes data from a database

-   `ALTER DATABASE` - modifies a database
-   `CREATE TABLE` - creates a new table
-   `ALTER TABLE` - modifies a table
-   `DROP TABLE` - deletes a table
-   `CREATE INDEX` - creates an index (search key)
