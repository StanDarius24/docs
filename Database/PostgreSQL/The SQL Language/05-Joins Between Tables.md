Thus far, our queries have only accessed `one table at a time.` Queries can access` multiple tables at once`, or access the same table in such a way that multiple rows of the table are being processed` at the same time`. Queries that access multiple tables (or multiple instances of the same table) at one time are called `join queries`. They combine rows from one table with rows from a second table, with an expression specifying which rows are to be paired. For example, to return all the weather records together with the location of the associated city, the database needs to compare the` city` column of each row of the `weather` table with the `name` column of all rows in the cities table, and select the pairs of rows where these values match.This would be accomplished by the following query:

```SQL
SELECT * FROM weather JOIN cities ON city = name;
```

```SQL
          city | temp_lo | temp_hi | prcp | date        | name          | location 
---------------+---------+---------+------+------------ +---------------+---------
 San Francisco | 46      | 50      | 0.25 | 1994-11-27 |  San Francisco | (-194,53) 
 San Francisco | 43      | 57      | 0    | 1994-11-29 |  San Francisco | (-194,53) 
(2 rows)
```

Observe two things about the result set:

• There is no result row for the city of Hayward. This is because there is no matching entry in the cities table for Hayward, so the join ignores the unmatched rows in the weather table. We will see shortly how this can be fixed. 
• There are two columns containing the city name. This is correct because the lists of columns from the weather and cities tables are concatenated. In practice this is undesirable, though, so you will probably want to list the output columns explicitly rather than using `*`:

```SQL
SELECT city, temp_lo, temp_hi, prcp, date, location 
	FROM weather JOIN cities ON city = name;
```

Since the columns all had different names, the parser automatically found which table they belong to. If there were duplicate column names in the two tables you'd need to `qualify` the column names to show which one you meant, as in:

```SQL
SELECT weather.city, weather.temp_lo, weather.temp_hi, 
	weather.prcp, weather.date, cities.location 
	FROM weather JOIN cities ON weather.city = cities.name;
```

It is widely considered good style to qualify all column names in a join query, so that the query won't fail if a duplicate column name is later added to one of the tables

Join queries of the kind seen thus far can also be written in this form:

```SQL
SELECT * 
	FROM weather, cities 
	WHERE city = name;
```

This syntax pre-dates the `JOIN/ON` syntax, which was introduced in `SQL-92`. The tables are simply listed in the `FROM` clause, and the comparison expression is added to the `WHERE` clause. The results from this older implicit syntax and the newer explicit `JOIN/ON `syntax are identical. But for a reader of the query, the explicit syntax makes its meaning easier to understand: The join condition is introduced by its own key word whereas previously the condition was mixed into the `WHERE` clause together with other conditions.

Now we will figure out how we can get the Hayward records back in. What we want the query to do is to scan the `weather` table and for each row to find the matching `cities` row(s). If no matching row is found we want some “empty values” to be substituted for the `cities` table's columns. This kind of query is called an `outer join`. (The joins we have seen so far are `inner joins`.) The command looks like this:

```SQL
SELECT * 
	FROM weather LEFT OUTER JOIN cities ON weather.city = cities.name;
```

```SQL
city | temp_lo | temp_hi | prcp | date | name | location 
---------------+---------+---------+------+------------ +---------------+---------- 
Hayward       | 37 | 54 |      | 1994-11-29 | | 
San Francisco | 46 | 50 | 0.25 | 1994-11-27 | 
San Francisco | (-194,53) 
San Francisco | 43 | 57 | 0    | 1994-11-29 | 
San Francisco | (-194,53) 
(3 rows)
```

This query is called a `left outer join` because the table mentioned on the left of the join operator will have each of its rows in the output at least once, whereas the table on the right will only have those rows output that match some row of the left table. When outputting a left-table row for which there is no right-table match, empty (null) values are substituted for the right-table columns.

We can also join a table against itself. This is called a `self join`. As an example, suppose we wish to find all the weather records that are in the temperature range of other weather records. So we need to compare the `temp_lo` and `temp_hi` columns of each weather row to the `temp_lo` and `temp_hi `columns of all other `weather` rows. We can do this with the following query:

```SQL
SELECT w1.city, w1.temp_lo AS low, w1.temp_hi AS high, 
	   w2.city, w2.temp_lo AS low, w2.temp_hi AS high 
	FROM weather w1 JOIN weather w2 
		ON w1.temp_lo < w2.temp_lo AND w1.temp_hi > w2.temp_hi;
```

```SQL
          city | low | high | city | low | high 
---------------+-----+------+---------------+-----+------ 
 San Francisco | 43 | 57 | San Francisco | 46 | 50 
	   Hayward | 37 | 54 | San Francisco | 46 | 50 
(2 rows)
```

Here we have relabeled the weather table as `w1` and `w2` to be able to distinguish the left and right side of the join. You can also use these kinds of aliases in other queries to save some typing, e.g.:

```SQL
SELECT * 
	FROM weather w JOIN cities c ON w.city = c.name;
```

You will encounter this style of abbreviating quite frequently.
