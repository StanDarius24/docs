Tokens such as `SELECT`, `UPDATE`, or `VALUES` in the example above are examples of key words, that is, words that have a fixed meaning in the `SQL` language. The tokens `MY_TABLE` and A are examples of identifiers. They identify names of tables, columns, or other database objects, depending on the command they are used in. Therefore they are sometimes simply called “names”. Key words and identifiers have the same lexical structure, meaning that one cannot know whether a token is an identifier or a key word without knowing the language. A complete list of key words can be found in Appendix C.
