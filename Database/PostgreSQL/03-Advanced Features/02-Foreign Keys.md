Consider the following problem: You want to make sure that no one can insert rows in the weather table that do not have a matching entry in the cities table. This is called maintaining the referential integrity of your data. In simplistic database systems this would be implemented (if at all) by first looking at the cities table to check if a matching record exists, and then inserting or rejecting the new weather records. This approach has a number of problems and is very inconvenient, so PostgreSQL can do this for you.

The new declaration of the tables would look like this:
```SQL
CREATE TABLE cities (
	name varchar(80) primary key,
	location point
);
```

```SQL
CREATE TABLE weather (
	city varchar(80) references cities(name),
	temp_lo int,
	temp_hi int,
	prcp real,
	date date
);
```

Now try inserting an invalid record:

```SQL
INSERT INTO weather VALUES ('Berkeley', 45, 53, 0.0, '1994-11-28');
```

```SQL
ERROR: insert or update on table "weather" violates foreign key
constraint "weather_city_fkey"
DETAIL: Key (city)=(Berkeley) is not present in table "cities".
```

The behavior of foreign keys can be finely tuned to your application. We will not go beyond this simple example in this tutorial, but just refer you to Chapter 5 for more information. Making correct use of foreign keys will definitely improve the quality of your database applications, so you are strongly encouraged to learn about them.
