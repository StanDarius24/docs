Inheritance is a concept from `object-oriented databases`. It opens up interesting new possibilities of database design.

Let's create two tables: A table cities and a table capitals. Naturally, capitals are also cities, so you want some way to show the capitals implicitly when you list all cities. If you're really clever you might invent some scheme like this:

```SQL
CREATE TABLE capitals (
	name text,
	population real,
	elevation int, -- (in ft)
	state char(2)
);
```

```SQL
CREATE TABLE non_capitals (
	name text,
	population real,
	elevation int -- (in ft)
);
```

```SQL
CREATE VIEW cities AS
	SELECT name, population, elevation FROM capitals
		UNION
	SELECT name, population, elevation FROM non_capitals;
```

This works `OK` as far as querying goes, but it gets ugly when you need to update several rows, for one thing.

A better solution is this:

```SQL
CREATE TABLE cities (
	name text,
	population real,
	elevation int -- (in ft)
);
```

```SQL
CREATE TABLE capitals (
	state char(2) UNIQUE NOT NULL
) INHERITS (cities);
```

In this case, a row of capitals inherits all columns (name, population, and elevation) from
its parent, cities. The type of the column name is text, a native PostgreSQL type for variable length character strings. The capitals table has an additional column, state, which shows its state abbreviation. In PostgreSQL, a table can inherit from zero or more other tables.

For example, the following query finds the names of all cities, including state capitals, that are located at an elevation over 500 feet:

```SQL
SELECT name, elevation
	FROM cities
	WHERE elevation > 500;
```

which returns:

```SQL
	  name | elevation
-----------+-----------
 Las Vegas | 2174
  Mariposa | 1953
   Madison | 845
(3 rows)
```

On the other hand, the following query finds all the cities that are not state capitals and are situated at an elevation over 500 feet:

```SQL
SELECT name, elevation
	FROM ONLY cities
	WHERE elevation > 500;
```

```SQL
	  name | elevation
-----------+-----------
 Las Vegas | 2174  
  Mariposa | 1953
(2 rows)
```

Here the `ONLY` before cities indicates that the query should be run over only the cities table, and not tables below cities in the inheritance hierarchy. Many of the commands that we have already discussed — `SELECT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE` — support this `ONLY` notation.

*NOTE*

`Although inheritance is frequently useful, it has not been integrated with unique constraints or foreign keys, which limits its usefulness.`
