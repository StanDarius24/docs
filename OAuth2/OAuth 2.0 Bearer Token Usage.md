Bearer Tokens are the predominant type of access token used with OAuth 2.0.

A Bearer Token is an opaque string, not intended to have any meaning to clients using it. Some servers will issue tokens that are a short string of hexadecimal characters, while others may use structured tokens such asÂ [JSON Web Tokens](https://oauth.net/2/jwt/).
