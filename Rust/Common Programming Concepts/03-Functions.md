#rust 

Functions are prevalent in Rust code. You’ve already seen one of the most important functions in the language: the `main` function, which is the entry point of many programs. You’ve also seen the `fn` keyword, which allows you to declare new functions.

Rust code uses _snake case_ as the conventional style for function and variable names, in which all letters are lowercase and underscores separate words. Here’s a program that contains an example function definition:

```rust
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, world!");
    another_function();
}
fn another_function() {
    println!("Another function.");
}
```
We define a function in Rust by entering `fn` followed by a function name and a set of parentheses. The curly brackets tell the compiler where the function body begins and ends.
We can call any function we’ve defined by entering its name followed by a set of parentheses. Because `another_function` is defined in the program, it can be called from inside the `main` function. Note that we defined `another_function` _after_ the `main` function in the source code; we could have defined it before as well. Rust doesn’t care where you define your functions, only that they’re defined somewhere in a scope that can be seen by the caller.

### Parameters

We can define functions to have _parameters_, which are special variables that are part of a function’s signature. When a function has parameters, you can provide it with concrete values for those parameters. Technically, the concrete values are called _arguments_, but in casual conversation, people tend to use the words _parameter_ and _argument_ interchangeably for either the variables in a function’s definition or the concrete values passed in when you call a function.
```rust
fn main() {
    another_function(5);
}

fn another_function(x: i32) {
    println!("The value of x is: {x}");
}
```

### Statements and Expressions

Function bodies are made up of a series of statements optionally ending in an expression. So far, the functions we’ve covered haven’t included an ending expression, but you have seen an expression as part of a statement. Because Rust is an expression-based language, this is an important distinction to understand. Other languages don’t have the same distinctions, so let’s look at what statements and expressions are and how their differences affect the bodies of functions.
-   **Statements** are instructions that perform some action and do not return a value.
-   **Expressions** evaluate to a resultant value. Let’s look at some examples.

### Functions with Return Values
Functions can return values to the code that calls them. We don’t name return values, but we must declare their type after an arrow (`->`). In Rust, the return value of the function is synonymous with the value of the final expression in the block of the body of a function. You can return early from a function by using the `return` keyword and specifying a value, but most functions return the last expression implicitly.
```rust
fn five() -> i32 {
    5
}

fn main() {
    let x = five();

    println!("The value of x is: {x}");
}
```
