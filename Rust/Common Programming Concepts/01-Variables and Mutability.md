#rust

When a variable is immutable, once a value is bound to a name, you can’t change that value. To illustrate this, let’s generate a new project called _variables_ in your _projects_ directory by using `cargo new variables`.

```rust
fn main() { 
	let x = 5; 
	println!("The value of x is: {x}"); 
	x = 6; 
	println!("The value of x is: {x}"); 
}
```

```bash
$ cargo run
   Compiling variables v0.1.0 (file:///projects/variables)
error[E0384]: cannot assign twice to immutable variable `x`

  |         -

  |         help: consider making this binding mutable: `mut x`
3 |     println!("The value of x is: {x}");
4 |     x = 6;
  |     ^^^^^ cannot assign twice to immutable variable

error: could not compile `variables` due to previous error
```

```Rust
fn main() {
    let mut x = 5;
    println!("The value of x is: {x}");
    x = 6;
    println!("The value of x is: {x}");
}
```

### [Constants]

Like immutable variables, _constants_ are values that are bound to a name and are not allowed to change, but there are a few differences between constants and variables.

First, you aren’t allowed to use `mut` with constants. Constants aren’t just immutable by default—they’re always immutable. You declare constants using the `const` keyword instead of the `let` keyword, and the type of the value _must_ be annotated. We’re about to cover types and type annotations in the next section, ["Data Types"] so don’t worry about the details right now. Just know that you must always annotate the type.

Constants can be declared in any scope, including the global scope, which makes them useful for values that many parts of code need to know about.

The last difference is that constants may be set only to a constant expression, not the result of a value that could only be computed at runtime.

```rust
const THREE_HOURS_IN_SECONDS: u32 = 60 * 60 * 3;
```

### [Shadowing]

As you saw in the guessing game tutorial in [Chapter 2], you can declare a new variable with the same name as a previous variable. Rustaceans say that the first variable is _shadowed_ by the second, which means that the second variable is what the compiler will see when you use the name of the variable. In effect, the second variable overshadows the first, taking any uses of the variable name to itself until either it itself is shadowed or the scope ends. We can shadow a variable by using the same variable’s name and repeating the use of the `let` keyword as follows:
```rust
fn main() { 
	let x = 5; 
	let x = x + 1; 
	{ 
		let x = x * 2; 
		println!("The value of x in the inner scope is: {x}");
	} 
	
	println!("The value of x is: {x}"); 
}
```

This program first binds `x` to a value of `5`. Then it creates a new variable `x` by repeating `let x =`, taking the original value and adding `1` so the value of `x` is then `6`. Then, within an inner scope created with the curly brackets, the third `let` statement also shadows `x` and creates a new variable, multiplying the previous value by `2` to give `x` a value of `12`. When that scope is over, the inner shadowing ends and `x` returns to being `6`. When we run this program, it will output the following:

Shadowing is different from marking a variable as `mut`, because we’ll get a compile-time error if we accidentally try to reassign to this variable without using the `let` keyword. By using `let`, we can perform a few transformations on a value but have the variable be immutable after those transformations have been completed.

The other difference between `mut` and shadowing is that because we’re effectively creating a new variable when we use the `let` keyword again, we can change the type of the value but reuse the same name. For example, say our program asks a user to show how many spaces they want between some text by inputting space characters, and then we want to store that input as a number:

```rust
	let spaces = " "; 
	let spaces = spaces.len();
```
