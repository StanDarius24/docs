Vi is a powerful text editor included on most Linux systems. Many people swear by vi and find it faster than any other editor once they’ve learned its key bindings. You can even use vi key bindings in Bash.

## Mode Switching

As a short recap, vi is a modal editor – there’s an insert mode and a standard command mode. In insert mode, vi functions similar to a normal text editor. In command mode, you take advantage of these key bindings.

-   **i** – Enter insert mode.
-   **Escape** – Leave insert mode. If you’re already in command mode, Escape does nothing, so you can press Escape to ensure you’re in command mode.
