#### Amazon S3 - Buckets

- Amazon S3 allows people to store objects (files) in "buckets" (directories)
- Buckets must have a globally unique name (across all regions all accounts)
- S3 looks like a global service but buckets are created in a region
- Naming convention
	- No uppercase, No underscore
	- 3-63 characters long
	- Not an IP
	- Must start with lowercase letter or number
	- Must NOT start with the prefix `xn-`
	- Must NOT end with the suffix `-s3alias`

##### Amazon S3 - Objects
- Objects (files) have a Key
- The key is the FULL path:
	- s3://my-bucket/my_file.txt
- The key is composed of prefix + object name
	- s3://my-bucket/my_folder1/my_file.txt
- There's no concept of "directories" within buckets (although the UI will trick you to think otherwise)
- Just keys with very long names that contain slashes ("/")

##### Amazon S3 - Objects (cont)
- Object values are the content of the body:
	- Max. Object Size is 5TB (5000GB)
	- If uploading more than 5GB, must use "multi-part upload"
- Metadata (list of text key / value pairs - system or user metadata)
- Tags (Unicode key/value pair - up to 10) - useful for security/lifecycle
- Version ID (if versioning is enable)

##### Amazon S3 - Security
- User-Based
	- IAM Policies - Which API calls should be allowed for a specific user from IAM
- Resource-Based
	- Bucket Policies - bucket wide rules from the S3 console - allows cross account
	- Object Access Control List (ACL) - fine grain (can be disabled)
	- Bucket Access Control List (ACL) - less common (can be disabled)
- Note: an IAM principal can access an S3 object if
	- The user IAM permissions ALLOW it OR the resource policy ALLOWS it
	- AND there's no explicit DENY
- Encryption: encrypt objects in Amazon S3 using encryption keys

##### S3 Bucket Policies
- JSON based policies
	- Resources: buckets and objects
	- Effect: Allow/Deny
	- Actions: Set of API to Allow or Deny
	- Principal: The account or user to apply the policy to
- Use S3 bucket for policy to:
	- Grant public access to the bucket
	- Force objects to be encrypted at upload
	- Grant access to another account(Cross Account)

##### Amazon S3 - Versioning
- You can version your files in Amazon S3
- It is enabled at the bucket level
- Same key overwrite will change the "version": 1,2,3 ...
- It is best practice to version your buckets
	- Protect against unintended deletes (ability to restore a version)
	- Easy roll back to previous version
- Notes:
	- Any file that is not versioned prior to enabling versioning will have version "null"
	- Suspending versioning does not delete the previous versions

##### Amazon S3 - Replication (CRR & SRR)
- Must enable Versioning in source and destination buckets
- Cross-Region Replication (CRR)
- Same-Region Replication (SRR)
- Buckets can be in different AWS accounts
- Copying is asynchronous
- Must give proper IAM permissions to S3
- Use cases:
	- CRR - compliance, lower latency access, replication across accounts
	- SRR - log aggregation, live replication between production and test accounts

##### S3 Storage Classes
- Amazon S3 Standard - General Purpose
- Amazon S3 Standard-Infrequent Access (IA)
- Amazon S3 One Zone-Infrequent Access
- Amazon S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval
- Amazon S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval
- Amazon S3 Glacier Deep Archive
- Amazon S3 Intelligent Tiering

- Can move between classes manually or using S3 Lifecycle configurations

---

#### S3 Durability and Availability
- Durability:
	- High durability of objects across multiple AZ
	- If you store 10 M objects with Amazon S3, you can on average expect to incur a loss of a single object once every 10.000 years
	- Same for all storage classes
- Availability:
	- Measures how readily available a service is
	- Varies depending on storage class
	- Example: S3 standard has 99.99% availability = not available 53 minutes a year

 ---

#### Amazon S3 Standard - General Purpose
- 99.99% Availability
- Use for frequently accessed data
- Low latency and high throughput
- Sustain 2 concurrent facility failures

---

#### Amazon S3 Standard-Infrequent Access (IA)
- For data that is less frequently accessed, but requires rapid access when needed
- Lower cost than S3 Standard

- Amazon S3 Standard-Infrequent Access (S3 Standard-IA)
	- 99,9% Availability
	- Use cases: Disaster Recovery, backups
- Amazon S3 One Zone-Infrequent Access (S3 One Zone-IA)
	- High durability (99.99%) in a single AZ; data lost when AZ is destroyed
	- 99.5% Availability
	- Use Cases: Storing secondary backup copies of on-premises data, or data you can recreate

---

#### Amazon S3 Glacier Storage Classes
- Low-cost object storage meant for archiving/backup
- Pricing: price for storage + object retrieval cost
- Amazon S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval
	- Milisecond retrieval, great for data accessed once a quarter
	- Minimum storage duration of 90 days
- Amazon S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval (formerly Amazon S3 Glacier):
	- Expedited (1 to 5 minutes), Standard (3 to 5 hours), Bulk (5 to 12 hours) - free
	- Minimum storage duration of 90 days
- Amazon S3 Glacier Deep Archive - for long term storage:
	- Standard (12 hours), Bulk (48 hours)
	- Minimum storage duration of 180 days

---

#### S3 Intelligent-Tiering
- Small monthly monitoring and auto-tiering fee
- Moves objects automatically between Access Tiers based on usage
- There are no retrieval charges in S3 Intelligent-Tiering
- Frequent Access tier (automatic): default tier
- Infrequent Access tier ( automatic): objects not accessed for 30 days
- Archive Instant Access tier (automatic): objects not accessed for 90 days
- Archive Access tier (optional): configurable from 90 days to 700+ days
- Deep Archive Access tie (optional): config. from 180 days to 700+ days

#### AWS Snow Family
- Highly-secure, portable devices to collect and process data at the edge, and migrate data into and out of AWS.
- Data migration: Snowcone, Snowball Edge, Snowmobile.
- Edge computing: Snowcone, Snowball Edge.

![[Screenshot 2023-07-17 at 22.07.45.png]]

Challenges:
- Limited connectivity
- Limited bandwidth
- High network cost
- Shared bandwidth (cant maximize the line)
- Connection stability

AWS Snow Family: offline devices to perform data migrations. If it takes more than a week to transfer over the network, use Snowball devices!

Directi upload to S3:
- client - 10Git/s -> Amazon S3 bucket

With Snow Family:
- client ( AWS Snowball) - ship -> AWS Snowball (import/export) Amazon S3 bucket

Snowball Edge (for data transfers)
- Physical data transport solution: move TBs or PBs of data in or out of AWS
- Alternative to moving data over the network (and paying network fees)
- Pay per data transfer job
- Provide block storage and Amazon S3-compatible object storage
- Snowball Edge Storage Optimized
	- 80TB of HDD capacity for block volume and S3 compatible object storage
- Snowball Edge Compute Optimized
	- 42Tb of HDD or 28TB NVMe capacity for block volume and S3 compatible object storage
- Use cases: large data cloud migrations, DC decommission, disaster recovery

#### AWS Snowcone & Snowcone SSD
- Small, portable computing, anywhere, rugged & secure, withstands harsh environments
- Light
- Snowcone 8TB of HDD
- Snowcone SSD 15 TB of SSD storage
- Use snowcone where snowball does not fit (space constrained environment)
- Must provide your own battery/cables
- Can be sent back to AWS offline, or connect it to internet and use AWS DataSync to send data

AWS Snowmobile
- Transfer exabytes of data (1M TBs)
- Each snowmobile has 100PB or capacity
- High security: temperature controlled, GPS, 24/7 video
- Better then Snowball if you transfer more than 10PB

#### Snow Family - Usage Process
1. Request Snowball devices from the AWS console for delivery
2. Install the snowball client / AWS OpsHub on your servers
3. Connect the snowball to your servers and copy files using the client
4. Ship back the device when you're done (goes to the right AWS facility)
5. Data will be loaded into an S3 bucket
6. Snowball is completely wiped

#### What is Edge Computing
- Process data while it s being created on an edge location
	- A truck on the road, a ship on the sea, a mining station underground...
- These locations may have
	- Limited / no internet access
	- Limited / no easy access to computing power
- We setup a Snowball Edge / Snowcone device to do edge computing
- Use cases of Edge Computing:
	- Preprocess data
	- Machine learning at the edge
	- Transcoding media streams
- Eventually we can ship back the device to AWS

#### Snow Family - Edge Computing
- Snowcone & Snowcone SSD (smaller)
	- 2 cpu, 4 gb memory, wired or wireless access
	- USB-C power
	- 8TB storage
- Snowball Edge - Compute Optimized
	- 104 v CPUs, 416 gb RAM
	- Optional GPU
	- 28TB NVMe 42 TB HDD
- Snowball Edge - Storage Optimized
	- Up to 40 vCPUs, 80Gib RAM, 80TB storage
	- Object storage clustering available
- All: Can run EC2 Instances & AWS Lambda functions (using AWS IoT Greengras)
- Long-term deployment options:1 and 3 years discounted pricing

---

#### AWS OpsHub
- Historically, to use Snow Family devices, you needed a CLI
- Today, you can use AWS OpsHub to manage your SNow Family Device
	- Unlocking and configuring single or clustered devices
	- Transferring files
	- Launching and managing instances running on Snow Family Devices
	- Monitor device metrics (storage capacity, active instances on your device)
	- Launch compatible AWS services on your devices

---

#### Hybrid Cloud for Storage
- AWS is pushing for "hybrid cloud"
	- Part of your infrastructure is on-premises
	- Part of your infrastructure is on the cloud
- This can be due to
	- Long cloud migrations
	- Security requirements
	- Compliance requirements
	- IT strategy
- S3 is a proprietary storage technology (unlike EFS/NFS), so how do you expose the S3 data on-premises
- AWS Storage Gateway!

#### AWS Storage Gateway
- Bridge between on-premises data and cloud data in S3
- Hybrid storage service to allow on-premises to seamlessly use the AWS Cloud
- Use cases: disaster recovery, backup & restore, tiered storage
- Types of Storage Gateway:
	- File Gateway
	- Volume Gateway
	- Tape Gateway
