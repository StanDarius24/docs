#AWS
 
 - AWS responsibility - Security of the Cloud
	- Protecting infrastructure (hardware, software, facilities, and networking) that runs all the AWS services
	- Managed services like S3, DynamoDB, RDS, etc.
- Customer responsibility - Security in the Cloud
	- For EC2 instance, customer is responsible for management of the guest OS (including security patches and updates), firewall & network configuration, IAM
	- Encrypting application data
- Shared controls
	- Patch Management, Configuration Management, Awareness & Training

---

##### Example, for RDS
- AWS responsibility:
	- Manage the underlying EC2 instance, disable SSH access
	- Automated DB patching
	- Automated OS patching
	- Audit the underlying instance and disks & guarantee it functions
- Your responsibility:
	- Check the ports / IP / security group inbound rules in DB's SG
	- In-database user creation and permissions
	- Creating a database with or without public access
	- Ensure parameter groups or DB is configured to only allow SSL connections
	- Database encryption setting

---

##### Example, for S3
- AWS responsibility
	- Guarantee you get unlimited storage
	- Guarantee you get encryption
	- Ensure separation of the data between different customers
	- Ensure AWS employees cant access your data
- Your responsibility
	- Bucket configuration
	- Bucket policy / public setting
	- IAM user and roles
	- Enabling encryption

##### Sample Reference Architecture for DDoS Protection
![[screenshot-ibm-learning.udemy.com-2023.12.03-21_40_02.png]]

---

#### AWS Shield
- AWS Shield Standard:
	- Free service that is activated for every AWS customer
	- Provides protection from attacks such as SYN/UDP Floods, Reflection attacks and other layer 3/layer 4 attacks
- AWS Shield Advanced:
	- Optional DDoS mitigation service ($3,000 per month per organization)
	- Protect against more sophisticated attack on Amazon EC2, Elastic Load Balancing (ELB), Amazon CloudFront, AWS Global Accelerator, and Route 53
	- 24/7 access to AWS DDoS response team (DRP)
	- Protect against higher fees during usage spikes due to DDoS

---

##### AWS WAF - Web Application Firewall
- Protects your web applications from common web exploits (Layer 7)
- Layer 7 is HTTP (vs Layer 4 is TCP)
- Deploy on Application Load Balancer, API Gateway, CloudFront

- Define Web ACL (Web Access Control List):
	- Rules can include IP addresses, HTTP headers, HTTP body, or URI strings
	- Protects from common attacks - SQL injection and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
	- Size constraints, geo-match (block countries)
	- Rate-based rules (to count occurrences of events) - for DDoS protection

---

##### AWS Network Firewall
- Protect your entire Amazon VPC
- From Layer 3 to Layer 7 Protection
- Any direction, you can inspect
	- VPC to VPC traffic
	- Outbound to internet
	- Inbound from internet
	- To / from Direct Connect & Site-to-Site VPN

---

##### Penetration Testing on AWS Cloud
- AWS customers are welcome to carry out security assessments or penetration tests against their AWS infrastructure without prior approval for 8 services:
	- Amazon EC2 instances, NAT Gateways, and Elastic Load Balancers
	- Amazon RDS
	- Amazon CloudFront
	- Amazon Aurora
	- Amazon API Gateways
	- AWS Lambda and Lambda Edge functions
	- Amazon Lightsail resources
	- Amazon Elastic Beanstalk environments
- Prohibited Activities
	- DNS zone walking via Amazon Route 53 Hosted Zones
	- Denial of Service (DoS), Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS), Simulated DoS, Simulated DDoS
	- Port flooding
	- Protocol flooding
	- Request flooding (login request flooding, API request flooding)
- For any other simulated events, contact aws-security-simulated-event@amazon.com

---

##### Data at rest vs. Data in transit
- At rest: data stored or archived on a device
	- On a hard disk, on a RDS instance, in S3 Glacier Deep Archive, etc.
- In transit (in motion): data being moved from one location to another
	- Transfer from on-premises to AWS, EC2 to DynamoDB, etc.
	- Means data transferred on the network
- We want to encrypt data in both states to protect it!
- For this we leverage encryption keys

---

##### AWS KMS (Key Management Service)
- Anytime you hear "encryption" for an AWS service, it's most likely KMS
- KMS = AWS manages the encryption keys for us
- Encryption Opt-in:
	- EBS volumes: encrypt volumes
	- S3 buckets: Server-side encryption of objects
	- Redshift database: encryption of data
	- EFS drives: encryption of data
- Encryption Automatically enabled:
	- CloudTrail Logs
	- S3 Glacier
	- Storage Gateway

---

##### CloudHSM
- KMS => AWS manages the software for encryption
- CloudHSM => AWS provisions encryption hardware
- Dedicated Hardware (HSM = Hardware Security Module)
- You manage your own encryption keys entirely (not AWS)
- HSM device is temper resistant, FIPS 140-2 Level 3 compliance
![[screenshot-ibm-learning.udemy.com-2023.12.28-00_27_34.png]]

---

##### Types of KMS Keys
- Customer Managed Key:
	- Create, manage and used by the customer, can enable or disable
	- Possibility of rotation policy (new key generated every year, old key preserved)
	- Possibility to bring-your-own-key
- AWS Managed Key:
	- Created, managed and used on the customer's behalf by AWS
	- Used by AWS services (aws/s3, aws/ebs, aws/redshift)
- AWS Owned Key:
	- Collection of CMKs that an AWS service owns and manages to use in multiple accounts
	- AWS can use those to protect resources in your account (but you can't view the keys)
- CloudHSM Keys (custom keystore):
	- Keys generated from your own CloudHSM hardwire device
	- Cryptographic operations are performed within the CLoudHSM cluster

---

- Questions that can be solved by AWS Config:
	- Is there unrestricted SSH access to my security groups?
	- Do my buckets have any public access?
	- How has my ALB configuration changed over time?
- You can receive alerts (SNS notifications) for any changes
- AWS Config is a per-region service
- Can be aggregated across regions and accounts
