ECS, Lambda, Batch, Lightsail

#### What is Docker?
- Docker is a software development platform to deploy apps
- Apps are packaged in containers that can be run on any OS
- Apps run the same, regardless of where they're run
	- Any machine
	- No compatibility issues
	- Predictable behavior
	- Less work
	- Easier to maintain and deploy
	- Works with any language, any OS, any technology
- Scale containers up and down very quickly (seconds)

tl;dr;

#### ECS (Elastic Container Service)

- Launch Docker containers on AWS
- You must provision & maintain the infrastructure (the EC2 instances)
- AWS takes care of starting/stopping containers
- Has integrations with the Application Load Balancer

#### Fargate

- Launch Docker containers on AWS
- You do not provision the infrastructure (no EC2 instances to manage) - simpler!
- Serverless offering
- AWS just runs containers for you based on the CPU/RAM you need

#### ECR (Elastic Container Registry)
- Elastic Container Registry
- Private Docker Registry on AWS
- This is where you store your Docker images so they can be run by ECS or Fargate

#### Whats serverless?
- Serverless is a new paradigm in which the developers dont have to manage servers anymore...
- They just deploy code
- They just deploy ... functions!
- Initially ... Serverless = FaaS (Function as a Service)
- Serverless was pioneered by AWS Lambda but now also includes anything thats managed: "databases, messaging, storage, etc"
- Serverless does not mean there are no servers... 
	it means you just dont manage / provision / see them

#### Why AWS Lambda
1. Amazon EC2
	- Virtual Servers in the Cloud
	- Limited by RAM and CPU
	- Continuously running
	- Scaling means intervention to add/remove servers
2. Amazon Lambda
	- Virtual functions - no servers to manage!
	- Limited by time - short executions
	- Run on-demand
	- Scaling is automated!

#### Benefits of AWS Lambda
- Easy Pricing:
	- Pay per request and compute time
	- Free tier of 1.000.000 AWS Lambda requests and 400.000 GBs of compute time
- Integrated with the whole AWS suite of services
- Event-Driven: functions get invoked by AWS when needed
- Integrated with many programming languages
- Easy monitoring through AWS CloudWatch
- Easy to get more resources per functions (up to 10GB of RAM!)
- Increasing RAM will also improve CPU and network!

Pay per calls:
	1.000.000 -> request free
	0.20$ -> per 1 million requests
Pay per duration:
	400.000 GB-seconds of compute time per month is FREE
	== 400.000 seconds if function is 1GB RAM
	== 3.200.000 seconds if function is 128 MB RAM
	After that 1$ for 600.000 GB-seconds
It is very cheap to run AWS Lambda so its very popular

#### Amazon API Gateway

![[screenshot-ibm-learning.udemy.com-2023.08.20-19_37_12.png]]
- Fully managed service for developers to easily create, publish, maintain, monitor, and secure APIs
- Serverless and scalable
- Supports RESTful APIs and WebSocket APIs
- Support for security, user authentication, API throttling, API keys, monitoring...

---
#### AWS Batch
- Fully managed batch processing at any scale
- Efficiently run 100.000s of computing batch jobs on AWS
- A "batch" job is a job with a start and an end (opposed to continuous)
- Batch will dynamically launch EC2 instances or Spot Instances
- AWS Batch provisions the right amount of compute/memory
- You submit or schedule batch jobs and AWS Batch does the rest!
- Batch jobs are defined as Docker images and run on ECS
- Helpful for cost optimizations and focusing less on the infrastructure

---

#### Batch vs Lambda
- Lambda:
	- Time limit
	- Limited runtimes
	- Limited temporary disk space
	- Serverless
- Batch:
	- No time limit
	- Any runtime as long as it's packaged as a Docker image
	- Rely on EBS / instance store for disk space
	- Relies on EC2 (can be managed by AWS)

---

#### Amazon Lightsail
- Virtual servers, storage, databases, and networking
- Low & predictable pricing
- Simpler alternative to using EC2, RDS, ELB, EBS, Route 53 ...
- Great for people with little cloud experience!
- Can setup notifications and monitoring of your Lightsail resources
- Use cases:
	- Simple web applications (has templates for LAMP, Nginx, MEAN, Node.js)
	- Websites (templates for WordPress, Magento, Plesk, Joomla)
	- Dev / Test environment
- Has high availability but no auto-scaling, limited AWS integrations

#### Summary:

1. Other Compute:
	- Docker: container technology to run applications
	- ECS: run Docker containers on EC2 instances
	- Fargate:
		- Run Docker containers without provisioning the infrastructure
		- Serverless offering (no EC2 instances)
	- ECR: Private Docker Images Repository
	- Batch: run batch jobs on AWS across managed EC2 instances
	- Lightsail: predictable & low pricing for simple application & DB stacks
2. Lambda:
	- Lambda is Serverless, Function as a Service, seamless scaling, reactive
	- Lambda Billing:
		- By the time run x by the RAM provisioned
		- By the number of invocations
	- Language Support: many programming languages except (arbitrary) Docker
	- Invocation time: up to 15 minutes
	- Use cases:
		- Create Thumbnails for images uploaded onto S3
		- Run a Serverless cron job
	- API Gateway: expose Lambda functions as HTTP API
