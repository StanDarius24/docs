1. How to choose an AWS Region?
 - `Compliance` with data governance and legal requirements: data never leaves a region without your explicit permission.
 - `Proximity` to customers: reduced latency.
 - `Available service` with a Region: new services and new features aren't available in every Region.
 - `Pricing` varies region to region and is transparent in the service pricing page.
2. AWS availability zones:
 - Each region has many availability zones. (ap-southeast-a2, ap-southeast-2b)
 - Each availability zone (AZ) is one or more discrete data centers with redundant power, networking, and connectivity.
 - They're separate from each other, so that they're isolated from disasters.
 - They're connected with high bandwidth, ultra-low latency networking.
