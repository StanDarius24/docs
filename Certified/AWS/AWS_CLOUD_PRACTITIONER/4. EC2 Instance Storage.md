EBS Volume:
- It's a network drive
	- It uses the network to communicate the instance, which means there might be a bit of latency
	- It can be detached from an EC2 instance and attached to another one quickly
- It's locked to an Availability Zone (AZ)
	- To move a volume across, you first need to snapshot it
- Have a provisioned capacity (size in GBs, and IOPS)

AMI = Amazon Machine Image
- AMI are a customization of an EC2 instance
	- You add your own software, configuration, operating system, ect.
	- Faster boot/config time bcs all your software is prepackaged
- AMI are built for a specific region
- You can launch EC2 instances from:
	- A Public AMI: AWS provided
	- Your own AMI: you make and maintain them yourself
	- An AWS Marketplace AMI: an AMI someone else made

EC2 Image Builder:
- Used to automate the creation of Virtual Machines or container images;
- => Automate the creation, maintain, validate and test EC2 AMIs;
- Can be run on a schedule;
- Free service

EC2 Instance Store
- EBS volumes are network drives with good but limited performance;
- If you need a high-performance hardware disk, use EC2 Instance Store;
- Better I/O performance;
- EC2 Instance Store lose their storage if they're stopped;
- Good for buffer/cache/scratch data/temporary content
- Risk of data loss if hardware fails;
- Backups and Replication are your responsibility;

EFS = Elastic File System
- Managed NFS (network file system) that can be mounted on 100s of EC2;
- EFS works with Linux EC2 instances in multi-AZ
- Highly available, scalable, expensive, pay per use, no capacity planning

EFS Infrequent Access (EFS-IA)
- Storage class that is cost-optimized for files not accessed every day;
- Up to 92% lower cost compared to EFS Standard;
- EFS will automatically move your files to EFS-IA based on the last time they were accessed;
- Enable EFS-IA with a LIfecycle Policy;
- Transparent to the applications accessing EFS.

Amazon FSx
- Launch 3rd party high-performance file systems on AWS;
- Fully managed service;
- For windows
	- A fully managed, highly reliable, and scalable Windows native shared file system;
	- Build on Windows File Server
	- Supports SMB protocol & Windows NTFS
	- Integrated with Microsoft Active Directory
- For Lustre
	- A fully managed, high-performance, scalable file storage for High Performance Computing (HPC)
	- The name Lustre is derived from "Linux" and "Cluster"
	- Machine Learning, Analytics, VIdeo Processing, etc.
	- Scales up to 100s GB/s, millions of IOPS, sub-ms latencies

### Summary:
- EBS VOLUMES:
	- network drives attached to one EC2 instance at a time
	- mapped to an Availability zones
	- can use EBS snapshots for backups/transferring EBS volume across AZ
- AMI: Create redy-to-use EC2 instances with our customizations
- EC2 Image Builder: automatically build, test and distribute AMIs
- EC2 Instance Store:
	- High performance hardware disk attached to our EC2 instance
	- Lost if our instance is stopped/terminated
- EFS: network file system, can be attached to 100s of instances in a region;
- EFS-IA: cost-optimized storage class for infrequent accessed files;
- FSx for Windows: Network File System for Windows servers;
- FSx for Lustre High Performance Computing Linux file system.
