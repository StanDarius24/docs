#### Why make a global application?
- A global application is an application deployed in multiple geographies
- On AWS: this could be Regions and / or Edge Locations
- Decreased Latency
	- Latency is the time it takes for a network packet to reach a server
	- It takes time for a packet from Asia to reach the US
	- Deploy your applications closer to your users to decrease latency, better experience
- Disaster Recovery (DR)
	- If an AWS region goes down (earthquake, storms, power shutdown, politics)...
	- You can fail-over to another region and have your application still working
	- A DR plan is important to increase the availability of your application
- Attack protection: distributed global infrastructure is harder to attack

#### Global AWS Infrastructure
- Regions: For deploying applications and infrastructure
- Availability Zones: Made of multiple data centers
- Edge Locations (Points of Presence): for content delivery as close as possible to users.

#### Global Applications in AWS
- Global DNS: Route 53
	- Great to route users to the closest deployment with least latency
	- Great for disaster recovery strategies
- Global Content Delivery Network (CDN): CloudFront
	- Replicate part of your application to AWS Edge Locations - decrease latency
	- Cache common requests - improved user experience and decreased latency
- S3 Transfer Acceleration
	- Accelerate global uploads & downloads into Amazon S3
- AWS Global Accelerator
	- Improve global application availability and performance using the AWS global network

#### Amazon Route 53
- Route53 is a Managed DNS (Domain Name System)
- DNS is a collection of rules and records which helps clients understand how to reach a server through URLs.
- In AWS, the most common records are:
	- www.google.com => 12.34.56.78 == A record (IPv4)
	- www.google.com => 2001:3214:5434:000:000:65456:3454:2342 == AAAA IPv6
	- search.google.com => www.google.com == CNAME: hostname to hostname
	- example.com => AWS resource == Alias (ex: ELB, CLoudFront, S3, RDS, etc ...)

#### AWS CloudFront
- Content Delivery Network (CDN)
- Improves read performance, content is cached at the edge
- Improves user experience
- 216 Point of Presence globally (edge locations)
- DDoS protection (because worldwide), integration with Shield, AWS Web Application Firewall

---

#### CloudFront - Origins
- S3 bucket
	- For distributing files and caching them at the edge
	- Enhanced security with CloudFront Origin Access Control (OAC)
	- OAC is replacing Origin Access Identity (OAI)
	- CloudFront can be used as an ingress (to upload files to S3)
- Custom Origin (HTTP)
	- Application Load Balancer
	- EC2 instance
	- S3 website (must first enable the bucket as a static S3 website)
	- Any HTTP backend you want

---

#### CloudFront vs S3 Cross Region Replication
- CloudFront:
	- Global Edge network
	- Files are cached for a TTL (maybe a day)
	- Great for static content that must be available everywhere
- S3 Cross Region Replication:
	- Must be setup for each region you want replication to happen
	- Files are updated in near real-time
	- Read only
	- Great for dynamic content that needs to be available at low-latency in few regions

---

#### S3 Transfer Acceleration
- Increase transfer speed by transferring file to an AWS edge location which will forward the data to the S3 bucket in the target region

---

#### AWS Global Accelerator
- Improve global application availability and performance using the AWS global network
- Leverage the AWS internal network to optimize the route to your application (60% improvement)
- 2 Anycast IP are created for your application and traffic is sent through Edge Locations
- The Edge locations send the traffic to your application

---

#### AWS Global Accelerator vs CloudFront
- They both use the AWS global network and its edge locations around the world
- Both services integrate with AWS Shield for DDoS protection.
- CloudFront - Content Delivery Network
	- Improves performance for your cacheable content (such as images and videos)
	- Content is served at the edge

- Global Accelerator
	- No caching, proxying packets at the edge to applications running in one or more AWS Regions.
	- Improves performance for a wide range of applications over TCP or UDP
	- Good for HTTP use cases that require static IP addresses
	- Good for HTTP use cases that required deterministic, fast regional failover

---

#### AWS Outposts
- Hybrid Cloud: businesses that keep an on-premises infrastructure alongside a cloud infrastructure
- Therefore, two ways of dealing with IT systems:
	- One for the AWS cloud (using the AWS console, CLI and AWS APIs)
	- One for their on-premises infrastructure
- AWS Outposts are "server racks" that offers the same AWS infrastructure, services, APIs & tools to build your own applications on-premises just as in the cloud
- AWS will setup and manage "Outposts Racks" within your on-premises infrastructure and you can start leveraging AWS services on-premises
- You are responsible for the Outposts Rack physical security
- Benefits:
	- Low-latency access to on-premises systems
	- Local data processing
	- Data residency
	- Easier migration from on-premises to the cloud
	- Fully managed service
- Some services that work on Outposts

---

#### AWS WaveLength
- WaveLength Zones are infrastructure deployments embedded within the telecommunications providers' datacenters at the edge of the 5G networks
- Brings AWS services to the edge of the 5G networks
- Example: EC2, EBS, VPC...
- Ultra-low latency applications through 5G networks
- Traffic doesn't leave the Communication Service Provider's CSP network
- High-bandwidth and secure connection to the parent AWS Region
- No additional charges or service agreements
- Use cases: Smart Cities, ML-assisted diagnostics, Connected Vehicles, Interactive Live Video Streams, AR/VR, Real-time Gaming, ...

---

#### AWS Local Zones
- Places AWS compute, storage, database, and other selected AWS services closer to end users to run latency-sensitive applications
- Extend your VPC to more locations - "Extension of an AWS Region"
- Compatible with EC2, RDS, ECS, EBS, ElastiCache, Direct Connect ...
- Example:
	- AWS Region:
	- AWS Local Zones
