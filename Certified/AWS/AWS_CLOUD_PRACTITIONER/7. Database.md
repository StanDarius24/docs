Databases Intro:
- Storing data on disk (EFS, EBS, EC2 Instance Store, S3) can have its limits
- Sometimes, you want to store data in a database...
- You can structure the data
- You build indexes to efficiently query/search through the data
- You define relationships between your datasets

- Databases are optimized for a purpose and come with different features, shapes and constraints

- Relational Databases - can use the SQL language to perform queries/lookups
- NoSQL Databases 
	Flexibility: easy to evolve data model
	Scalability: designed to scale-out by using distributed clusters
	High-performance: optimized for a specific data model
	Highly functional: types optimized for the data model
	Examples: Key-value, document, graph, in-memory, search databases
	JSON

Databases & Shared Responsibility on AWS:
- AWS offers use to manage different databases
- Benefits include:
	- Quick Provisioning, High Availability, Vertical and Horizontal Scaling
	- Automated Backup & Restore, Operations, Upgrades
	- Operating System Patching is handled by AWS
	- Monitoring, alerting
- Note: many databases technologies could be run on EC2, but you must handle yourself the resiliency, backup, patching, high availability, fault tolerance, scaling...

#### AWS RDS Overview
- RDS -> Relational Database Service
- It's a managed DB service for DB use SQL as a query language.
- It allows you to create databases in the cloud that are managed by AWS
	- Postgres
	- MySQL
	- MariaDB
	- Oracle
	- Microsoft SQL Server
	- Aurora
Advantage over RDS vs deploying DB on EC2
- RDS is a managed service:
	- Automated provisioning, OS patching
	- Continuous backups and restore to specific timestamp (Point in Time Restore)!
	- Monitoring dashboards
	- Read replicas for improved read performance
	- Multi AZ setup for DR (Disaster Recovery)
	- Maintenance windows for upgrades
	- Scaling capability (vertical and horizontal)
	- Storage backed by EBS (gp2 or io l)
- BUT YOU CANT SSH INTO THE INSTANCE :(

Amazon Aurora
- is a proprietary technology from AWS
- PostgreSQL and MySQL both supported as Aurora DB
- Aurora is AWS cloud optimized and claims 5x performance improvement over MySQL on RDS, over 3x performance of Postgres on RDS
- Aurora storage automatically grows in increments of 10gb up to 128tb
- Aurora costs more than RDS. (20% more) but is more efficient
- Not in the free tier

#### RDS Deployments: Read Replicas, Multi-AZ

- Read Replicas:
	- Scale the read workload of your DB
	- Can create up to 15 Read Replicas
	- Data is only written to the main DB

- Multi-AZ
	- Failover in case of AZ outage (high availability)
	- Data is only read/written to the main database

#### RDS Deployments: Multi-Region
- Multi-Region (Read Replicas)
	- Disaster recovery in case of region issue
	- Local performance for global reads
	- Replication cost

#### Amazon ElastiCache
- The same way RDS is to get managed Relational Databases...
- ElastiCache is to get managed Redis or Memcached
- Caches are in-memory databases with high performance, low latency
- Helps reduce load off databases for read intensive workloads
- AWS takes care of OS maintenance / patching, optimizations, setup, configuration, monitoring, failure recovery and backups

#### Dynamo DB
- Fully Managed Highly available with replication across 3 AZ
- NoSQL database - not a relational database
- Scales to massive workloads, distributed "serverless" database
- Millions of requests per seconds, trillions of row, 100s of TB storage
- Fast and consistent in performance
- Single-digit millisecond latency - low latency retrieval
- Integrated with IAM for security, authorization and administration
- Low cost and auto scaling capabilities
- Standard & Infrequent Access (IA) Table Class

Is a key/value Database

#### DynamoDB Accelerator - DAX
- Fully Managed in-memory cache for DynamoDB
- 10x performance improvement - single - digit millisecond latency to microseconds latency - when accessing your DynamoDB tables
- Secure, highly scalable & highly available
- Difference with ElastiCache at the CCP level: DAX is only used for and is integrated with DynamoDB, while ElastiCache can be used for other databases

#### DynamoDB - Global Tables
- Make a DynamoDB table accessible with low latency in multiple-regions
- Active-Active replication (read/write to any AWS Region)

#### Redshift
- Redshift is based on PostgreSQL, but its not used for OLTP
- Its OLAP - online analytical processing (analytics and data warehousing)
- Load data once every hour, not every second
- 10x better performance than other data warehouses, scale to PBs of data
- Columnar storage of data (instead of row based)
- Massively Parallel Query Execution (MPP), highly available
- Pay as you go based on the instances provisioned
- Has a SQL interface for performing the queries
- BI tools such as AWS Quicksight or Tableau integrate with it

#### Amazon EMR
- EMR -> Elastic MapReduce
- EMR helps creating Hadoop clusters (Big Data) to analyze and process vast amount of data
- The clusters can be made of hundreds of EC2 instances
- Also supports Apache Spark, HBase, Presto, Flink...
- EMR takes care of all the provisioning and configuration
- Auto-scaling and integrated with Spot instances
- Use cases: data processing, machine learning, web indexing, big data...
- Exam Tip: If you see Hadoop cluster -> Amazon EMR

#### Amazon Athena
- Serverless query service to perform analytics against S3 objects
- Uses standard SQL language to query the files
- Supports CSV, JSON, ORC, Avro, and Parquet (build on Presto)
- 5$ per TB of data scanned
