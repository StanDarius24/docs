#### 1. Amazon EC2

- EC2 is one of the most popular of AWS' offering
- EC2 = Elastic Compute Cloud = Infrastructure as a Service
- It mainly consists in the capability of:
	- Renting virtual machines (EC2)
	- Storing data on virtual drives (EBS)
	- Distributing load across machines (ELB)
	- Scaling the services using an auto-scaling group (ASG)
- Knowing EC2 is fundamental to understand how the Cloud works

EC2 User Data:
- It is possible to bootstrap our instances using an EC2 User data script.
- bootstrapping means launching commands when a machine starts
- That script is only run once at the instance first start
- EC2 user data is used to automate boot tasks such as:
	- Installing updates; software; downloading common files;
- The EC2 User Data Script runs with the root user.

EC2 Volumes:
- An EBS (Elastic Block Store) Volume is a network drive you can attach to your instances while they run;
- It allows your instances to persist data, even after their termination;
- They can only be mounted to one instance at a time (at the CPP level);
- They are bound to a specific availability zone;
- Analogy: Think of them as a "network USB stick";
- Free tier: 30GB of free EBS storage of General Purpose (SSD) or Magnetic per month.

##### Security Groups Good to know
- Can be attached to multiple instances 
- Locked down to a region / VPC combination 
- Does live “outside” the EC2 – if traffic is blocked the EC2 instance won’t see it 
- It’s good to maintain one separate security group for SSH access 
- If your application is not accessible (time out), then it’s a security group issue 
- If your application gives a “connection refused“ error, then it’s an application error or it’s not launched 
- All inbound traffic is blocked by default
- All outbound traffic is authorised by default

##### EC2 Instances Purchasing Options
- On-Demand Instances – short workload, predictable pricing, pay by second 
	- Linux or Windows - billing per second, after the first minute
	- All other operating systems - billing per hour
	- Has the highest cost but no upfront payment 
	- No long-term commitment
	- Recommended for short-term and un-interrupted workloads, where you can't predict how the application will behave
	
- Reserved (1 & 3 years) 
	- Reserved Instances – long workloads 
	- Up to 72% discount compared to On-demand
	- Convertible Reserved Instances – long workloads with flexible instances 
	- You can buy and sell in the Reserved Instance Marketplace
	
- Savings Plans (1 & 3 years) – commitment to an amount of usage, long workload 
	- Get a discount based on long-term usage (up to 72% - same as RIs)
	- Commit to a certain type of usage ($10/hour for 1 or 3 years)
	- Usage beyond EC2 Savings Plans is billed at the On-Demand price
	
- Spot Instances – short workloads, cheap, can lose instances (less reliable) 
	- Can get a discount of up to 90% compared to On-demand
	- Instances that you can “lose” at any point of time if your max price is less than the current spot price
	- The MOST cost-efficient instances in AWS
	- Useful for workloads that are resilient to failure
	
- Dedicated Hosts – book an entire physical server, control instance placement 
	- A physical server with EC2 instance capacity fully dedicated to your use
	- Allows you address compliance requirements and use your existing server- bound software licenses
	- Purchasing Options:
		- On-demand – pay per second for active Dedicated Host
		- Reserved - 1 or 3 years (No Upfront, Partial Upfront, All Upfront)
	- The most expensive option

- Dedicated Instances – no other customers will share your hardware 
	- Instances run on hardware that’s dedicated to you
	- May share hardware with other instances in same account
	
- Capacity Reservations – reserve capacity in a specific AZ for any duration
	- Reserve On-Demand instances capacity in a specific AZ for any duration
	- You always have access to EC2 capacity when you need it
	- No time commitment (create/cancel anytime), no billing discounts
	- Combine with Regional Reserved Instances and Savings Plans to benefit from billing discounts
	- You’re charged at On-Demand rate whether you run instances or not
	- Suitable for short-term, uninterrupted workloads that needs to be in a specific AZ

##### Which purchasing option is right for me?
- On demand: coming and staying in resort whenever we like, we pay the full price
- Reserved: like planning ahead and if we plan to stay for a long time, we may get a good discount.
- Savings Plans: pay a certain amount per hour for certain period and stay in any room type (e.g., King, Suite, Sea View, …)
- Spot instances: the hotel allows people to bid for the empty rooms and the highest bidder keeps the rooms. You can get kicked out at any time
- Dedicated Hosts: We book an entire building of the resort
- Capacity Reservations: you book a room for a period with full price even you don’t stay in it

##### Shared Responsibility Model for EC2
AWS:
- Infrastructure (global network security)
- Isolation on physical hosts
- Replacing faulty hardware
- Compliance validation
Customer:
- Security Groups rules
- Operating-system patches and updates
- Software and utilities installed on the EC2 instance
- IAM Roles assigned to EC2 & IAM user access management
- Data security on your instance

##### EC2 Section – Summary
- EC2 Instance: AMI (OS) + Instance Size (CPU + RAM) + Storage + security groups + EC2 User Data 
- Security Groups: Firewall attached to the EC2 instance 
- EC2 User Data: Script launched at the first start of an instance 
- SSH: start a terminal into our EC2 Instances (port 22) 
- EC2 Instance Role: link to IAM roles 
- Purchasing Options: On-Demand, Spot, Reserved (Standard + Convertible), Dedicated Host, Dedicated Instance
