#### 1. Amazon EC2

- EC2 is one of the most popular of AWS' offering
- EC2 = Elastic Compute Cloud = Infrastructure as a Service
- It mainly consists in the capability of:
	- Renting virtual machines (EC2)
	- Storing data on virtual drives (EBS)
	- Distributing load across machines (ELB)
	- Scaling the services using an auto-scaling group (ASG)
- Knowing EC2 is fundamental to understand how the Cloud works

EC2 User Data:
- It is possible to bootstrap our instances using an EC2 User data script.
- bootstrapping means launching commands when a machine starts
- That script is only run once at the instance first start
- EC2 user data is used to automate boot tasks such as:
	- Installing updates; software; downloading common files;
- The EC2 User Data Script runs with the root user.

EC2 Volumes:
- An EBS (Elastic Block Store) Volume is a network drive you can attach to your instances while they run;
- It allows your instances to persist data, even after their termination;
- They can only be mounted to one instance at a time (at the CPP level);
- They are bound to a specific availability zone;
- Analogy: Think of them as a "network USB stick";
- Free tier: 30GB of free EBS storage of General Purpose (SSD) or Magnetic per month.
