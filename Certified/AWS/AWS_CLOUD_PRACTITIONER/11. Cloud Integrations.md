#AWS

- When we start deploying multiple applications, they will inevitably need to communicate with one another
- There are two patterns of application communication
1. Synchronous communications (application to application)
2. Asynchronous / Event based (application to queue to application)

- Synchronous between application can be problematic if there are sudden spikes of traffic
- What if you need to suddenly encode 1000 videos but usually its 10?
- In that case, it's better to decouple your applications:
	- using SQS: queue model
	- using SNS: pub/sub model
	- using Kinesis: real-time data streaming model
- These services can scale independently from our application!

#### Amazon SQS - Simple Queue Service

![[screenshot-ibm-learning.udemy.com-2023.10.08-19_23_09.png]]

- Oldest AWS offering ( over 10 years old)
- Fully managed service (~serverless), use to decouple applications
- Scales from 1 message per second to 10,000s per second
- Default retention of messages: 4 days, maximum of 14 days
- No limit to how many messages cam be in the queue
- Messages are deleted after they're read by consumers
- Low latency (<10 ms on publish and receive)
- Consumers share the work to read messages & scale horizontally

SQS to decouple between application tiers

FIFO Queue 
	- FIFO = First In First Out (ordering of messages in the queue)
	- Messages are processed in order by the consumer

#### Amazon Kinesis

- Kinesis = real-time big data streaming
- Managed service to collect, process, and analyze real-time streaming data at any scale
- Kinesis Data Streams: low latency streaming to ingest data at scale from hundreds of thousands of sources
- Kinesis Data Firehose: load streams into S3, Redshift, ElasticSearch, etc...
- Kinesis Data Analytics: perform real-time analytics on streams using SQL
- Kinesis Video Streams: monitor real-time video streams for analytics or ML

#### Amazon SNS
- What if you want to send one message to many receivers?
![[screenshot-ibm-learning.udemy.com-2023.10.08-20_11_54.png]]

- The "event publishers" only sends message to one SNS topic
- As many "event subscribers" as we want to listen to the SNS topic notifications
- Each subscriber to the topic will get all the messages
- Up to 12.500.000 subscriptions per topic, 100.000 topics limit

##### Amazon MQ
- SQS, SNS are "cloud-native" services: proprietary protocols from AWS
- Traditional applications running from on-premises may use open protocols such as: MQTT, AMQP, STOMP, Openwire, WSS
- When migrating to the cloud, instead of re-engineering the application to use SQS and SNS, we can use Amazon MQ
- Amazon MQ is a managed message broker service for RabbitMQ and ActivaMQ
- Amazon MQ doesn't "scale" as much as SQS/SNS
- Amazon MQ runs on servers, can run in Multi-AZ with failover
- Amazon MQ has both queue feature (~SQS) and topic features (~SNS)

##### Integration Section - Summary
- SQS:
	- Queue service in AWS
	- Multiple Producers, messages are kept up to 14 days
	- Multiple Consumers share the read and delete message when done
	- Use to decouple applications in AWS
- SNS:
	- Notification service in AWS
	- Subscribers: Email, Lambda, SQS, HTTP, Mobile...
	- Multiple Subscribers, send all messages to all of them
	- No message retention
- Kinesis: real-time data streaming, persistence and analysis
- Amazon MQ: managed message broker for ActiveMQ and RabbitMQ in the cloud (MQTT, AMQP... protocols)
