## IAM (Identity and Access Management, Global service)
- Root account created by default, shouldn't be used or shared
- Users are people within your organization, and can be grouped
- Groups only contain users, not other groups
- Users don't have to belong to a group, and user can belong to multiple groups

### IAM Security Tools:
- IAM Credentials Report (account-level), a report that lists all your account's users and the status of their various credentials;
### IAM Access Advisor (user-level)
- Access advisor shows the service premissions granted to a user and when those services were last accessed.

---

Best practices:
- Don't use the root account except for AWS account setup;
- One physical user = One AWS user
- Assign users to groups and assign permissions to groups
- Create a strong password policy
- Use and enforce the use of MFA
- Create and use Roles for giving permissions to AWS services
- Use Access Keys for Programmatic Access
- Audit permissions for your account with the IAM Credentials Report
- Never share IAM users & Access Keys

### Shared Responsibility Model for IAM
1. AWS:
	- Infrastructure (global network security);
	- Configuration and vulnerability analysis;
	- Compliance validation;
2. You:
	- Users, Groups, Roles, Policies management and monitoring;
	- Enable MFA on all accounts;
	- Rotate all your keys often;
	- Use IAM tools to apply appropriate permissions;
	- Analyze access patterns & review permissions;

### Summary:
- Users: mapped to a pshysical user, has a password for AWS Console;
- Groups: contains users only;
- Policies: JSON document that outlines permissions for users or groups;
- Roles: for EC2 instances or AWS services;
- Security: MFA + Password Policy;
- AWS CLI: manage your AWS services using the command-line;
- AWS SDK: manage your AWS services using a programming language;
- Access Keys: access AWS using the CLI or SDK;
- Audit: IAM Credential Reports & IAM Access Advisor;
