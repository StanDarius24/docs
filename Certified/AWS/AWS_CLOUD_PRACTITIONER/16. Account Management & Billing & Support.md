#AWS
##### AWS Organizations
- Global service
- Allows to manage multiple AWS accounts
- The main account is the master account
- Cost Benefits:
	- Consolidated billing across all accounts - single payment method
	- Pricing benefits from aggregated usage (volume discount for EC2, S3, ...)
	- Pooling of Reserved EC2 instances for optimal savings
- API is available to automate AWS account creation
- Restrict account privileges using Service Control Policies (SCP)

---

##### Multi Account Strategies
- Create accounts per departament, per cost center, per dev/test/prod, based on regulatory restrictions (using SCP), for better resource isolation (ex: VPC), to have separate per-account service limits, isolated account for logging
- Multi Account vs One Account Multi VPC
- Use tagging standards for billing purposes
- Enable CloudTrail on all accounts, send logs to central S3 account
- Send CloudWatch Logs to central logging account

---
##### Organizational Units (OU) 

![[screenshot-ibm-learning.udemy.com-2024.01.04-19_44_38.png]]

---

##### Service Control Policies (SCP)
- Whitelist or blacklist actions
- Applied at the OU or Account level
- Does not apply to the Master Account
- SCP is applied to all the Users and Roles of the Account, including Root
- The SCP does not affect service-linked roles
	- Service-linked roles enable other AWS services to integrate with AWS Organizations and can't be restricted by SCPs
- SCP must have an explicit Allow (does not allow anything by default)
- Use cases:
	- Restrict access to certain services (for example:cent use EMR)
	- Enforce PCI compliance by explicitly disabling services

---

##### AWS Organization - Consolidated Billing
- When enabled, provides you with:
	- Combined Usage - combine the usage across all AWS accounts in the AWS Organization to share the volume pricing, Reserved Instances and Savings Plans discounts
	- One Bill - get one bill for all AWS Accounts in the AWS Organization
- The management account can turn off reserved Instances discount sharing for any account in the AWS Organization, including itself

---

	- Automate ongoing policy management using guardrails
	- Detect policy violations and remediate them
	- Monitor compliance through an interactive dashboard
- AWS Control Tower runs on top of AWS Organizations:
	- It automatically sets up AWS Organizations to organize accounts and implement SCPs (Service Control Policies)

---

##### AWS Resource Access Manager (AWS RAM)
- Share AWS resources that you own with other AWS accounts
- Share with any account or within your Organization
- Avoid resource duplication!

---

##### AWS Service Catalog
- Users that are new to AWS have too many options, and may create stacks that are not compliant / in line with the rest of the organization
- Some users just want a quick self-service portal to launch a set of authorized products pre-defined by admins
- Includes: virtual machines, databases, storage options, etc...

---

##### Pricing Models in AWS
- AWS has 4 pricing models:
- PAY AS YOU GO: pay for what you use, remain agile, responsive, meet scale demands
- Save when you reserve: minimize risks, predictably manage budgets, comply with long-terms requirements
