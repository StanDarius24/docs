##### What is CloudFormation

- CloudFormation is a declarative way of outlining your AWS Infrastructure, for any resources (most of them are supported).
- For example, within a CloudFormation template, you say:
	- I want a security group
	- I want two EC2 instances using this security group
	- I want an S3 bucket
	- I want a load balancer (ELB) in front of these machines
- Then CloudFormation creates those for you, in the `right order`, with the `exact configuration` that you specify

---

##### Benefits of AWS CloudFormation (1/2)
- Infrastructure as code
	- No resources are manually created, which is excellent for control
	- Changes to the infrastructure are reviewed through code
- Cost
	- Each resources within the stack is tagged with an identifier so you can easily see how much a stack costs you
	- You can estimate the costs of your resources using the CLoudFormation template
	- Saving strategy: In Dev, you could automation deletion of templates at 5 PM and recreated at 8 AM, safely.

---

##### Benefits of AWS CloudFormation (2/2)
- Productivity
	- Ability to destroy and re-create an infrastructure on the cloud on the fly
	- Automated generation of Diagram for your templates!
	- Declarative programming (no need to figure out ordering and orchestration)
- Don't re-invent the wheel
	- Leverage existing templates on the web!
	- Leverage the documentation
- Supports (almost) all AWS resources:
	- Everything we'll see in this course is supported
	- You can use "custom resources" for resources that are not supported

---

##### CloudFormation Stack Designer
- Example: WordPress CloudFormation Stack
- We can see all the resources
- We can see the relations between the components

---

##### AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK)
- Define your cloud infrastructure using a familiar language:
	- JavaScript/TypeScript, Python, Java and .NET
- The code is "compiled" into a CloudFormation template (JSON/YAML)
- You can therefore deploy infrastructure and application runtime code together
	- Great for Lambda functions
	- Great for Docker containers in ECS / EKS

##### Typical architecture: Web App 3-tier

- Managing infrastructure
- Deploying Code
- Configuring all the databases, load balancers, etc
- Scaling concerns

- Most web apps have the same architecture (ALB + ASG)
- All the developers want is for their code to run!

##### AWS Elastic Beanstalk Overview
- Elastic Beanstalk is a developer centric view of deploying an application on AWS
- It uses all the component's we've seen before: EC2, ASG, ELB, RDS, etc...
- But it's all in one view that's easy to make sense of!
- We still have full control over the configuration
- Beanstalk = Platform as a Service (PaaS)

---

##### Elastic Beanstalk
- Managed service
	- Instance configuration / OS is handled by Beanstalk
	- Deployment strategy is configurable but performed by Elastic Beanstalk
	- Capacity provisioning
	- Load balancing & auto-scaling
	- Application health-monitoring & responsiveness
- Just the application code is the responsibility of the developer
- Three architecture models:
	- Single Instance deployment: good for dev
	- LB + ASG: great for production or pre-production web applications
	- ASG only: great for non-web apps in production (workers, etc...)
- Health Monitoring
	- Health agent pushes metrics to CloudWatch
	- Checks for app health, publishes health events

##### AWS CodeDeploy
- We want to deploy pur application automatically
- Works with EC2 Instances
- Works with On-Premises Servers
- Hybrid service
- Servers / Instances must be provisioned and configured ahead of time with the CodeDeploy Agent

---
##### AWS CodeCommit
- Before pushing the application code to servers, it needs to be stored somewhere
- Developers usually store code in a repository, using the Git technology
- A famous public offering is GitHub, AWS' competing product is CodeCommit
- CodeCommit:
	- Source-control service that hosts Git-based repositories
	- Makes it easy to collaborate with others on code
	- The code changes are automatically versioned
- Benefits:
	- Fully managed
	- Scalable & highly available
	- Private, Secured, Integrated with AWS

---

##### AWS CodeBuild
- Code building service in the cloud (name is obvious)
- Compilers source code, run tests, and produces packages that are ready to be deployed (by CodeDeploy for example) 
![[Screenshot 2023-09-17 at 20.07.28.png]]
- Benefits
	- Fully managed, serverless
	- Continuously scalable & highly available
	- Secure
	- Pay-as-you-go pricing - only pay for the build time

---
##### AWS CodePipeline
- Orchestrate the different steps to have the code automatically pushed to production
	- Code => Build => Test => Provision => Deploy
	- Basis for CICD
- Benefits:
	- Fully managed, compatible with CodeCommit, CodeBuild, CodeDeploy, Elastic Beanstalk, CloudFormation, Github, 3rd-party services ( Github...) & custom plugins ...
	- Fast delivery & rapid updates

---

##### AWS CodeArtifact
- Software packages depend on each other to be build (also called code dependencies), and new ones are created
- Storing and retrieving these dependencies is called artifact management
- Traditionally you need to setup your own artifact management system
- CodeArtifact is a secure, scalable, and cost-effective artifact management for software development
- Works with common dependency management tools such as Maven, Gradle, npm, yarn, twine, pip, and NuGet
- Developers and CodeBuild can then retrieve dependencies straight from CodeArtifact

---

##### AWS CodeStar
- Unified UI to easily manage software development activities in one place
- "Quick way" to get started to correctly set-up CodeCommit, CodePipeline, CodeBuild, CodeDeploy, Elastic Beanstalk, EC2, etc...
- Can edit the code "in-the-cloud" using AWS Cloud9

---

##### AWS CLOUD9
- AWS CLOUD9 is a cloud IDE (Integrated Development Environment) for writing, running and debugging code
- "Classic" IDE (like Intellij, Visual Studio Code...) are downloaded on a computer before being used
- A cloud IDE can be used within a web browser, meaning you can work on your projects from your office, home, or anywhere, with internet with no setup necessary
- AWS Cloud9 also allows for code collaboration in real-time (pair programming)

---

##### AWS Systems Manager (SSM)
- helps you manage your EC2 and On-Premises systems at scale
- Another Hybrid AWS service
- Get operational insights about the state of your infrastructure
- Suite of 10+ products
- Most important features are:
	- Patching automation for enhanced compliance
	- Run commands across an entire fleet of servers
	- Store parameter configuration with the SSM Parameter Store
- Works for Linux, Windows, MacOS, and Raspberry PI OS (Raspbian)
- We need to install the SSM agent onto the systems we control
- Installed by default on Amazon Linux AMI & some Ubuntu AMI
- If an instance can't be controlled with SSM, it's probably an issue with the SSM agent!
- Thanks to the SSM agent, we can run commands, patch & configure our servers

---

##### System Manager- SSM Session Manager
- Allows you to start a secure shell on your EC2 and on-premises servers
- No SSH access, bastion hosts, or SSH keys needed
- No port 22 needed (better security)
- Supports Linux, macOS, and Windows
- Send session log data to S3 or CLoudWatch Logs

---

##### Systems Manager Parameter Store
- Secure storage for configuration and secrets
- API Keys, passwords, configurations...
- Serverless, scalable, durable, easy SDK
- Control access permissions using IAM
- Version tracking & encryption (optional)

---

##### AWS OpsWorks
- Chef & Puppet help you perform server configuration automatically, or repetitive actions
- They work great with EC2 & On-Premises VM
- AWS OpsWorks = Managed Chef & Puppet
- It's an alternative to AWS SSM
- Only provision standard AWS resources:
	- EC2 Instances, Databases, Load Balancers, EBS volumes...
- In the exam: Chef or Puppet needed => AWS OpsWorks

---

##### OpsWorks Architecture
