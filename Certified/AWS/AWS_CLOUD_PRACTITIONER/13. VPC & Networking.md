#AWS

- VPC is something you should know in depth for the AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate & AWS Certified SysOps Administrator
- At the AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner Level, you should know about:
	- VPC, Subnets, Internet Gateways & NAT Gateways
	- Security Groups, Network ACL (NACL), VPC Flow Logs
	- VPC Peering, VPC Endpoints
	- Site to Site VPN & Direct Connect
	- Transit Gateway
- I will just give you an overview, less than 1 or 2 questions at your exam.
- We'll have a look at the "default VPC" (created by default by AWS for you)
- There is a summary lecture at the end. It's okay if you dont understand it all

##### IP Adresses in AWS
- IPv4 - Internet Protocol version 4 (4.3 Billion Addresses)
	- Public IPv4 - can be used on the Internet
	- EC2 instance gets a new a public IP address every time you stop then start it (default)
	- Private IPv4 - can be used on private networks (LAN) such as internal AWS networking (102.168.1.1)
- Elastic IP - allows you to attach a fixed public IPv4 address to EC2 instance
	- Note: has ongoing cost if not attached to EC2 instance or if the EC2 instance is stopped
- IPv6 - Internet Protocol version 6 (3.4 x 10^38 Addresses)
	- Every IP address is public (no private range)
	- Example: 2001:db8:3333:4444:cccc:dddd:eeee:ffff

##### VPC & Subnets Primer

- VPC - Virtual Private Cloud: private network to deploy your resources (regional resource)
- Subnets allow you to partition your network inside your VPC (Availibility Zone resource)
- A public subnet is a subnet that is accessible from the internet
- A private subnet is a subnet that is not accessible from the internet
- To define access to the internet and between subnets, we use `Route Tables`.

##### Internet Gateway & NAT Gateways
- Internet Gateways helps our VPC instance connect with the internet
- Public Subnets have a route to the internet gateway
- NAT Gateways (AWS-managed) & NAT Instances (self-managed) allow your instances in your Private Subnets to access the internet while remaining private

##### Network ACL & Security Groups
- NACL (Network ACL)
	- A firewall which controls traffic from and to subnet
	- Can have ALLOW and DENY rules
	- Are attached at the Subnet level
	- Rules only include IP addresses
- Security Groups
	- A firewall that controls traffic to and from an ENI / an EC2 Instance
	- Can have only ALLOW rules
	- Rules include IP addresses and other security groups

##### VPC Flow Logs
- Capture information about IP traffic going into your interfaces:
	- VPC Flow Logs
	- Subnet Glow Logs
	- Elastic Network Interface Flow Logs
- Helps to monitor & troubleshoot connectivity issues. Example:
	- Subnets to internet
	- Subnets to subnets
	- Internet to subnets
- Captures network information from AWS managed interfaces too: Elastic Load Balancers, ElastiCache, RDS, Aurora, etc...
- VPC FLow logs data can go to S3, CloudWatch Logs, and Kinesis Data Firehose

---

##### VPC Peering
- Connect two VPC, privately using AWS network
- Make them behave as if they were in the same network
- Must not have overlapping CIDR (IP address range)
- VPC Peering connection is not transitive (must be established for each VPC that need to communicate with one another)

---

##### VPC Endpoints
- Endpoints allow you to connect to AWS Services using a private network instead of the public www network
- This gives you enhanced security and lower latency to access AWS services
- VPC Endpoint Gateway:S3 & DynamoDB
- VPC Endpoint Interface: the rest

##### AWS PrivateLink (VPC Endpoint Service)
- Most Secure & scalable way to expose a service to 1000s ofVPCs
- Does not require VPC peering, internet gateway, NAT, route tables...
- Requires a network load balancer (Service VPC) and ENI (Customer VPC)

##### Site to Site VPN & Direct Connect
- Site to Site VPN
	- Connect an on-premises VPN to AWS
	- The connection is automatically encrypted
	- Goes over the public internet
- Direct Connect (DX)
	- Establish a physical connection between on-premises and AWS
	- The connection is private, secure and fast
	- Goes over a private network
	- Takes at least a month to establish
![[screenshot-ibm-learning.udemy.com-2023.12.02-00_07_43.png]]
- On-premises: must use a Customer Gateway (CGW)
- AWS: must use a Virtual Private Gateway (VGW)

---

##### AWS Client VPN
- Connect from your computer using OpenVPN to your private network in AWS and on-premises
- Allow you to connect to your EC2 instances over a private IP (just as if you were in the private VPC network)
- Goes over public Internet

##### Network topologies can become complicated

---

##### Transit Gateway
- For having transitive peering between thousands of VPC and on-premises, hub-and-spoke (star) connection
- One single Gateway to provide this functionality
- Works with Direct Connect Gateway, VPN connections

##### VPC Closing Comments
- VPC: Virtual Private Cloud
- Subnets: Tied to an AZ, network partition of the VPC
- Internet Gateway: at the VPC level, provide Internet Access
- NAT Gateway / Instances: give internet access to private subnets
- NACL: Stateless, subnet rules for inbound and outbound
- Security Groups: Stateful, operate at the EC2 instance level or ENI
- VPC Peering: Connect two VPC with non overlapping IP ranges, nontransitive
- Elastic IP -fixed public IPv4, ongoing cost if not in-use
- VPC Endpoints: Provide private access to AWS Services within VPC
- PrivateLink: Privately connect to a service in a 3rd party VPC
- VPC Flow Logs: network traffic logs
- Site to Site VPN: VPN over public internet between on-premises DC and AS
- Client VPN: OpenVPN connection from your computer into your VPC
- Direct Connect: direct private connection to AWS
- Transit Gateway: Connect thousands of VPC and on-premises networks together
