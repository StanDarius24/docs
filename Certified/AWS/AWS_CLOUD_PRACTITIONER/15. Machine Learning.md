##### AWS Cloud Best Practices - Design Principles
- Scalability: vertical and horizontal 
- Disposable Resources: servers should be disposable & easily configured
- Automation: Serverless, Infrastructure as a Service, Auto Scaling…
- Loose Coupling:
	- Monolith are applications that do more and more over time, become bigger
	- Break it down into smaller, loosely coupled components
	- A change or a failure in one component should not cascade to other components
- Services, not Servers:
	- Don’t use just EC2
	- Use managed services, databases, serverless, etc !

##### Well Architected Framework 6 Pillars
1) Operational Excellence
2) Security
3) Reliability
4) Performance Efficiency
5) Cost Optimization
6) Sustainability
They are not something to balance, or trade-offs, they’re a synergy

---

1) Operational Excellence
- Includes the ability to run and monitor systems to deliver business value and to continually improve supporting processes and procedures
- Design Principles
	- Perform operations as code - Infrastructure as code
	- Annotate documentation - Automate the creation of annotated documentation after every build
	- Make frequent, small, reversible changes - So that in case of any failure, you can reverse it
	- Refine operations procedures frequently - And ensure that team members are familiar with it
	- Anticipate failure
	- Learn from all operational failures

##### Operational Excellence AWS Services

---

2) Security
- Includes the ability to protect information, systems, and assets while delivering business value through risk assessments and mitigation strategies
- Design Principles
	- Implement a strong identity foundation - Centralize privilege management and reduce (or even eliminate) reliance on long-term credentials - Principle of least privilege - IAM
	- Enable traceability - Integrate logs and metrics with systems to automatically respond and take action
	- Apply security at all layers - Like edge network, VPC, subnet, load balancer, every instance, operating system, and application
	- Automate security best practices
	- Protect data in transit and at rest - Encryption, tokenization, and access control
	- Keep people away from data - Reduce or eliminate the need for direct access or manual processing of data
	- Prepare for security events - Run incident response simulations and use tools with automation to increase your speed for detection, investigation, and recovery
	- Shared Responsibility Model

##### Security AWS Service

---

##### 3) Reliability
- Ability of a system to recover from infrastructure or service disruptions, dynamically acquire computing resources to meet demand, and mitigate disruptions such as misconfigurations or transient network issues
- Design Principles:
	- Test recovery procedures - Use automation to simulate different failures or to recreate scenarios that led to failures before
	- Automatically recover from failure - Anticipate and remediate failures before they occur
	- Scale horizontally to increase aggregate system availability - Distribute requests across multiple, smaller resources to ensure that they don't share a common point of failure
	- Stop guessing capacity - Maintain the optimal level to satisfy demand without over or under provisioning - Use Auto Scaling
	- Manage change in automation - Use automation to make changes to infrastructure

##### Reliability AWS Service

---

##### 4) Performance Efficiency
- Includes the ability to use computing resources efficiently to meet system requirements, and to maintain that efficiency as demand changes and technologies evolve
- Design Principles
	- Democratize advanced technologies - Advance technologies become services and hence you can focus more on product development
	- Go global in minutes - Easy deployment in multiple regions
	- Use serverless architectures - Avoid burden of managing servers
	- Experiment more often - Easy to carry out comparative testing
	- Mechanical sympathy - Be aware of all AWS services

##### Performance Efficiency AWS Service

---

##### 5) Cost Optimization
- Includes the ability to run systems to deliver business value at the lowest price point
- Design Principles:
	- Adopt a consumption mode - Pay only for what you use
	- Measure overall efficiency - Use CloudWatch
	- Stop spending money on data center operations - AWS does the infrastructure part and enables customer to focus on organization projects
	- Analyze and attribute expenditure - Accurate identification of system usage and costs, helps measure return on investment (ROI) - Make sure to use tags
	- Use managed and application level services to reduce cost of ownership - As managed services operate at cloud scale, they can offer a lower cost per transaction or service

##### Cost Optimization AWS Service

---

##### 6) Sustainability
- The sustainability pillar focuses on minimizing the environmental impacts of running cloud workloads.
- Design Principles:
	- Understand your impact – establish performance indicators, evaluate improvements
	- Establish sustainability goals – Set long-term goals for each workload, model return on investment (ROI)
	- Maximize utilization – Right size each workload to maximize the energy efficiency of the underlying hardware and minimize idle resources.
	- Anticipate and adopt new, more efficient hardware and software offerings – and design for flexibility to adopt new technologies over time.
	- Use managed services – Shared services reduce the amount of infrastructure; Managed services help automate sustainability best practices as moving infrequent accessed data to cold storage and adjusting compute capacity.
	- Reduce the downstream impact of your cloud workloads – Reduce the amount of energy or resources required to use your services and reduce the need for your customers to upgrade their devices

##### Sustainability AWS Service

##### AWS Right Sizing
- EC2 has many instance types, but choosing the most powerful instance type isn’t the best choice, because the cloud is elastic
- Right sizing is the process of matching instance types and sizes to your workload performance and capacity requirements at the lowest possible cost
- Scaling up is easy so always start small
- It’s also the process of looking at deployed instances and identifying opportunities to eliminate or downsize without compromising capacity or other requirements, which results in lower costs
- It’s important to Right Size…
	- before a Cloud Migration
	- continuously after the cloud onboarding process (requirements change over time)
- CloudWatch, Cost Explorer, Trusted Advisor, 3rd party tools can help
