## What is Responsible AI?

Responsible AI is an approach to developing, assessing, and deploying artificial intelligent systems in a safe, trustworthy, and ethical way. AI systems are the product of many decisions made by the people who develop and deploy them. From system purpose to how people interact with AI systems, Responsible AI can help proactively guide these decisions toward more beneficial and equitable outcomes. That means keeping people and their goals at the center of system design decisions and respecting enduring values like fairness, reliability, and transparency.


Microsoft is a global leader in Responsible AI, identifying six key principles that should guide AI development and usage. These principles are:

- **Fairness**: AI systems should treat all people fairly.
- **Reliability and safety**: AI systems should perform reliably and safely.
- **Privacy and security**: AI systems should be secure and respect privacy.
- **Inclusiveness**: AI systems should empower everyone and engage people.
- **Transparency**: AI systems should be understandable.
- **Accountability**: People should be accountable for AI systems.

## Fairness: AI systems should treat all people fairly

AI systems should treat everyone fairly, avoiding differential impacts on similarly situated groups. In contexts like medical treatment, loan applications, or employment, AI should provide consistent recommendations to individuals with similar symptoms, financial situations, or qualifications.

---
## Reliability and safety: AI systems should perform reliably and safely

To build trust, AI systems must operate reliably, safely, and consistently.
These systems need to function as designed, respond safely to unexpected conditions, and resist harmful manipulation. Their behavior and the variety of conditions they handle reflect the foresight of developers during design and testing.

## Privacy and security: AI systems should be secure and respect privacy

As artificial intelligence (AI) becomes more common, it's important to protect user privacy and data security. Microsoft and GitHub are aware of this tenet and both companies include privacy and security as key parts of their Responsible AI plan. This plan focuses on using principles to guide data practices.

## Inclusiveness: AI systems should empower everyone and engage people

Inclusiveness means ensuring that AI systems are fair, accessible, and empower everyone. Microsoft's Responsible AI standard recognizes that AI creators (including GitHub) must proactively design AI to include all people, communities, and geographies - especially those areas of society historically underrepresented.

## Transparency: AI systems should be understandable

Microsoft's Responsible AI principle of Transparency emphasizes that AI systems must be understandable and interpretable. Transparency is essential to build trust, ensure accountability, promote fairness, enhance safety, and support inclusiveness. Implementing transparency involves documenting data and models, creating explanatory interfaces, using AI debugging tools, constructing testing dashboards, and enabling logging and auditing. By being transparent, AI creators can foster trust and responsible AI use.

## Accountability: People should be accountable for AI systems

The Accountability principle states that AI creators should be responsible for how their systems operate. They need to continuously monitor system performance and mitigate risks. Accountability in the AI industry is becoming a pressing issue as high-profile cases of algorithmic harm, bias, and abuse come to light. Critics increasingly argue that without accountability, AI creators hold too much power over opaque systems impacting lives.
