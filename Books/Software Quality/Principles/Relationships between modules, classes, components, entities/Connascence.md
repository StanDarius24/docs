#softwareQuality 

Connascence is a software quality metric that describes different levels and dimensions of coupling. Two components are connascent if a change in one would require a change in the other as well. Lower connascence means higher code quality.

Why
-   Reducing connascence will reduce the cost of change for a software system.
-   Arguably one of the most important benefits of connascence is that it gives developers a vocabulary to talk about different types of coupling.

How
-   Each instance of connascence in a codebase is considered on 3 separate axes: strength, degree and locality.
-   It provides a system for comparing different types of dependency.
