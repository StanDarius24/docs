## Avoid Premature Optimization

---

	Programmers waste enormous amounts of time thinking about, or worrying about, the speed of non-critical parts of their programs, and these attempts at efficiency actually have a strong negative impact when debugging and maintenance are considered. We should forget about small efficiencies, say about 97% of the time: premature optimization is the root of all evil. Yet we should not pass up our opportunities in that critical 3%.

Understanding what is and isnâ€™t "premature" is critical.

Why
-   It is unknown upfront where the bottlenecks will be.
-   After optimization, it might be harder to read and thus maintain.

How
-   [Make It Work Make It Right Make It Fast (wiki.c2.com)](http://wiki.c2.com/?MakeItWorkMakeItRightMakeItFast)
-   Don't optimize until you need to, and only after profiling you discover a bottleneck to optimise.
