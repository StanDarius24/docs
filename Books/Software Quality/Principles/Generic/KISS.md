**Keep It Simple, Stupid**: most systems work best if they are kept simple rather than made complex.

Why
-   Less code takes less time to write, has less bugs, and is easier to modify.
-   Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication.
-   It seems that perfection is reached not when there is nothing left to add, but when there is nothing left to take away.

A simpler solution is better than a complex one because simple solutions are easier to maintain. This includes increased readability, understandability, and changeability. Furthermore, writing simple code is less error-prone.
