## Separation of Concerns

Separation of concerns is a design principle for separating a computer program into distinct sections, such that each section addresses a separate concern. For example, the business logic and the user interface of an application are separate concerns. Changing the user interface should not require changes to the business logic and vice versa.

	It is what I sometimes have called "the separation of concerns", which, even  if not perfectly possible, is yet the only available technique for effective ordering of one's thoughts, that I know of. This is what I mean by "focusing one's attention upon some aspect": it does not mean ignoring the other aspects, it is just doing justice to the fact that from this aspect's point of view, the other is irrelevant.

Why
-   Simplify development and maintenance of software applications.
-   When concerns are well-separated, individual sections can be reused, as well as developed and updated independently.

How
-   Break program functionality into separate modules that overlap as little as possible.
