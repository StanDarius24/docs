#designPatterns 

---

**Design patterns** are typical solutions to common problems in software design. Each pattern is like a blueprint that you can customize to solve a particular design problem in your code.

-   **Intent** of the pattern briefly describes both the problem and the solution.
-   **Motivation** further explains the problem and the solution the pattern makes possible.
-   **Structure** of classes shows each part of the pattern and how they are related.
-   **Code example** in one of the popular programming languages makes it easier to grasp the idea behind the pattern.

**Classification:

-   **Creational patterns** provide object creation mechanisms that increase flexibility and reuse of existing code.
    
-   **Structural patterns** explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures, while keeping these structures flexible and efficient.
    
-   **Behavioral patterns** take care of effective communication and the assignment of responsibilities between objects.
